# Introduction to Web Games

> Today, video game development is much more accessible than it’s ever been before. There are an immense amount of guides floating around on the web to help you improve and explore your specific interests in the topic. Despite this, however, new video game developers dread starting in the first place as the competition is fierce and they’re afraid that their game won’t stand out among the juggernauts. Luckily, you can utilize what others have learned to better your experience and push aside this mentality. There’s definitely enough room at the top for newcomers as well.

> First off, at least when you’re starting, keep your projects small. It’s common for newer developers to think they can build the next amazing game in the genre. Obviously these are great dreams to shoot for but there’s absolutely no way you can do this single-handedly in a reasonable amount of time. Even Stardew Valley, a game known for its development team of one man and the quality that came from him alone, took more than 4 years to develop with him working about 10 hours a day. This amount of dedication to your work and the subsequent potential burnout can cause you to sloppily implement features towards the later half of the development cycle or give up halfway through the process. If you want to actually finish your first project and be satisfied with the result, keep it small.

> Focus on a single game mechanic if you’re aiming to finish that project in a reasonable amount of time. If you’re making a platformer, all you need is jumping, falling, damage mechanics, and movement to make it happen. You don’t have to add a bunch of extensive features to the game like leveling up to make it a game. After all, your focus is to actually finish your project, so don’t bite off more than you can chew!

> Secondly, leverage your video game skills. It’s no secret that creating video games requires very diverse skill sets. Maybe you’re a social person with strong communication, or maybe you’re experienced with more technical fields like programming or graphical design. Even if no skills particularly shine in you, the most important thing is to know what you know and know what you don’t know. None of us are perfect so naturally some skills will be more developed than others. Choose a game design that suits those developed skills and slowly work up the skills that are harder for you. When you do this, you’ll produce a much better game and you’ll likely enjoy making it more too!

> In a similar vein, embrace your failures. Your first creation will probably not be a hit, and neither will your next few either. Despite this, the best way to learn what you’re doing wrong is through making these mistakes. You can’t make a hit with no prior experience or knowledge; nobody can. Notch might be known for Minecraft but he had been making games for nearly his entire life before that so it’s no surprise that he knew how to make a good one. It can be hard to take in criticism from outsiders without being personally hurt by what they say, but it’s crucial to try and separate your personal involvement with how it is received. This isn’t to say that you shouldn’t put your heart into it, but realize that the world is seeing your creation at face value and disregarding any amount of personal sacrifice put into the game, eliminating bias and showing you what you’re truly doing right or wrong.

> Next, make sure you’re actually choosing the right tools. When I first started programming video games, I was set on building everything myself — this wasn’t wise; in video game development, you don’t need to reinvent the wheel because it hasn’t been reinvented for a reason. Use an engine. _I'll cover this more under Resources._

> Most importantly, have fun with your development. I just stated this, but again, this is the most important aspect of video game development. Video game development isn’t something you’ll go into just to make a few quick dollars; it’s something to have fun with, exploring your creative mind and sharpening the skills of what you love doing. You need to love game programming to be able to put up with all of the bugs, errors, and goofy outcomes of what you code. You need to love your mistakes since it’s a step on the way to success. If you’re not enjoying the creation of your game you’ll just end up making some generic shovelware since these problems often plague those types of games and they never get fixed. Every day you develop your skills will grow, and eventually, as long as you keep going, you’ll make a great video game.

> Nobody knows how to code until they learn how to code, so that's fine. Just learn how to code. It's no big deal.

> Don't try to make your own game, just do tutorials until you can do them no more. Keep at it. _That's what this repo will attempt to do, give you a basis to start from._

> But don't forget those walks. Ask your parents to take you fishing or camping too, and spend time with friends. Don't become an antisocial egghead just because you've discovered how to teach yourself game development, because your social skills are also very important. Game development is a collaborative effort, and you need to be able to communicate and have fun with other people.

> If you find that you really enjoy making games and programming, you're in for a treat: everything they'll try to teach you in school will, from now on, appear useful and therefore interesting. The history of the conquistadors will stand out as a great idea for a strategy game, and you'll soak up every detail. Those really hard, abstract concepts in mathematics will be really useful to you, because you can find a use for them in your programming. Nobody else in class will see that applicability, and that's why you will graduate at the top of your class.

> It's not about being _smart_. It's about being _interested_. Thinking about everything in terms of how it could be used in a game will make you interested in _everything_.

> It's a myth that you need to be good at everything else in order to be good at programming and game design. It's the other way around: having a passion for game development and programming is what will make you able to soak up and apply knowledge in any field.

> Learn everything. Not because you might need it to be a programmer some day, but because you can use it in your games and scripts right now. Everything is applicable, and everything is usable, even sonnets, sports and politics. Use it all, it all belongs to you. All of it will make you a better game developer and, more importantly, a more interesting person.
