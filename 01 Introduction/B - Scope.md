# Scope

The scope for this repo will be limited to a single game and is not meant to be all-encompassing nor "modern". It will be limited to the techniques found in the HTML 5 2D Game Programming book.

However, we have found out that the source images and material from the book are no longer available. So, we will be adding a section for resource gathering based on a "best guess" of what is needed.
