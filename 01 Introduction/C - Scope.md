# Scope

## Project Focus

This repository will concentrate on developing a single game, focusing on foundational 2D game programming techniques. The initial course is intentionally focused and pragmatic, rather than attempting to cover the entire spectrum of modern game development.

### Key Constraints

- **Specificity**: Development is limited to 2D web-based games only. 3D, console and smartphone games are out of scope.
- **Approach**: Practical learning through focused implementation.

### Technique Scope

- Utilizing core HTML5 game programming methods.
- Pragmatic, focused implementation approach.
- Potential for multiple game projects within defined constraints.

### Learning Objectives

- Understand fundamental 2D game programming concepts.
- Navigate resource limitations through creative problem-solving.
- Provide a clear, linear path for learning game development techniques.
