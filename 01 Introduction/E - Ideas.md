# Where Does the Idea Come From

All games have an origin. Where this origin comes from is typically only known to an individual and may have gone through many permutations in their head, on paper or elsewhere before becoming a design to design it.

Game ideas can stem from a wide range of sources, from personal experiences and observations to existing media, trends, and even scientific concepts. Here's a breakdown of potential sources of inspiration:

- _Personal Experiences & Observations_

  Everyday life, relationships, dreams, or even frustrations can spark game concepts. Imagine a game based on a challenging task you faced, a funny interaction you witnessed, or a recurring dream you had.

- _Existing Media_

  Books, movies, TV shows, other games, and even music can provide inspiration for new game mechanics, storylines, or settings. Consider adapting a beloved story into a game, exploring a unique world from a book, or reimagining a classic game with a new twist.

- _Current Trends & Pop Culture_

  Paying attention to trending topics, social issues, and popular culture can lead to relevant and engaging game ideas. Think about creating a game that reflects current events, explores a trending social issue, or builds upon a popular character or theme.

- _Scientific Principles & Concepts_

  Science, technology, and even mathematics can provide a foundation for innovative game mechanics or unique gameplay experiences. Imagine a game based on the principles of physics, a simulation of a biological process, or a puzzle game built around a mathematical concept.

- _Genre Exploration_

  Focusing on a specific genre can lead to fresh ideas within that framework. Consider exploring different subgenres, experimenting with new gameplay mechanics within a familiar genre, or combining elements from different genres to create something unique.

- _Character Development_

  Building a game around a compelling character, whether a hero, villain, or even a quirky individual, can provide a strong narrative and gameplay focus. Consider developing a character with a unique backstory, motivations, and abilities to drive the game's story and mechanics.

- _Market Gaps_

  Identifying unmet needs or underserved niches in the gaming market can lead to innovative game ideas. Look for areas where existing games are lacking, or where a new approach could resonate with a specific audience.

- _Mind Mapping & Brainstorming_

  Utilizing techniques like mind mapping and brainstorming can help generate and explore numerous ideas, leading to unexpected connections and creative solutions.

In essence, game ideas can come from anywhere - it's about being open to inspiration from diverse sources and developing those sparks into fully-fledged game concepts.

As with games in general, web game ideas can come from a wide range of sources, including other games, books, movies, personal experiences, current events, art, music, hobbies, scientific principles, and even everyday life situations, essentially drawing inspiration from anything that can spark a creative concept and translate into a playable game mechanic on the web.

Key areas to look for inspiration:

- _Existing Games_

  Analyzing popular game mechanics and adapting them to a web format, or identifying gaps in existing genres to create something new.

- _Media & Entertainment_

  Drawing inspiration from stories, characters, or themes from books, movies, TV shows, or even music.

- _Real-world Activities_

  Transforming everyday activities or challenges into game mechanics, like puzzle solving, strategy, or simulation games.
