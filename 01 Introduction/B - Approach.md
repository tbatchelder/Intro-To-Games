# Approach

This repository will serve as a living document of the game development learning journey. Each chapter will:

- Provide clear, progressive learning modules.
- Include detailed notes and observations.
- Document challenges encountered and their solutions.
- Demonstrate the real-world problem-solving skills essential in programming and game design.

By maintaining this approach, we create an educational resource that goes beyond simple tutorials, offering insights into the practical aspects of game development.
