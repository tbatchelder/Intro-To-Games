# Purpose

The purpose of this git repository is to start learning about game design. This will be an initial attempt at writing a full program following the HTML 5 2D Game Programming book. It's a bit outdated, sure, but we still should be able to learn what works, what doesn't and something about Canvas at the least.

This will also be used as a tutorial that others should be able to follow along on. Each chapter in this repo will correspond to a chapter from the book. The chapter will include any notes, issues and resolutions which are found along the way.
